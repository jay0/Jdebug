Users can utilize Jdebug to assist in finding abnormal threads of their computing applications. The steps are:

1. Job submission. In the front-end machine, submit a computing application executing on the computing nodes with “bsub -I -n <process_number> <program_name> [<args>]” command and other desired configurations. After the job is successfully submitted, one can get the job id “jobid” of the job.

2. The use of Jdebug. When the program is abnormal or the users are anxious about whether the program is executed normally, they can run Jdebug with “Jdebug <jobid>” command in the front-end machine to analyze the program and find the abnormal threads. And one can access detailed data obtained by the tool in the “.Jdebug_<jobid>_<time>.res” file on current directory for further analysis.
